# Crowdfunding-Kickstarter (Interactive dashboard creation using Excel/PowerBI/Tableau) and SQL

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze Kickstarter crowdfunding data to understand project performance, funding success rates, category-wise trends, and geographic distribution. The project aims to provide actionable insights to creators and investors for improving campaign strategies and predicting success patterns.

## Questions(KPI's and Charts)
- Total Projects Launched – Overall count of Kickstarter campaigns.
- Successful Projects (%) – Percentage of projects that reached or exceeded funding goals.
- Failed Projects (%) – Percentage of campaigns that didn’t meet their goal.
- Total Pledged Amount – Sum of funds pledged across campaigns.
- Average Funding per Project – Average pledged amount per campaign.
- Category-wise Success Rate – Success percentage across project categories (e.g., Art, Games, Technology).
- Country-wise Success Rate – Geographic performance of campaigns.
- Projects by Launch Year/Month – Trends over time.
- Category-wise Success Rate (Bar Chart)
- Country-wise Performance (Map Visual)
- Pledged Amount vs. Goal (Scatter Plot)

## Process
- Data Collection & Cleaning
Imported Kickstarter dataset into Power BI.
Cleaned missing values, standardized categories, and converted date fields.
- Data Transformation
Created calculated columns/measures (e.g., Success Rate, Average Pledged).
Built relationships between tables if applicable.
- Visualization
Designed interactive dashboards with slicers and filters for category, country, and time.
Used bar, line, pie, and map visuals to highlight key metrics.

## Dashboard
- EXCEL 
- POWERBI 
- TABLEAU

## Insights
- Technology and Games categories attract high pledges but also have higher failure rates compared to Art or Music.
- Campaigns launched in certain months (e.g., mid-year) show better success trends.
- U.S.-based projects dominate the number of campaigns and pledged amounts.
- Projects with lower funding goals tend to succeed more frequently.
- Success rates are not evenly distributed across categories—creative arts often outperform high-capital projects.

## Final Conclusion
The analysis reveals that Kickstarter success depends heavily on category, funding goal, and geography. Creators can increase chances of success by setting realistic goals, choosing the right launch period, and focusing on categories with historically higher success. Investors can use these insights to identify high-potential campaigns and mitigate risks.
